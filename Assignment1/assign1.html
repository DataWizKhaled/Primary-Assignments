              The banks of <b>the Nile in the city of Minya</b>, adorned with
              the Egyptian flag, are embellished to welcome residents during the
              governorate's celebrations of its 103rd National Day. The
              festivities commemorate the locals' resistance against a train
              carrying British soldiers during the 1919 revolution, resulting in
              their deaths, including their leader.
